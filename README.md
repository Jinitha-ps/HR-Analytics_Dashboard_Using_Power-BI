# 🧑‍💻 HR Analytics Dashboard: Driving Workforce Strategy with Power BI

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project delivers an interactive **HR Analytics Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Power BI**. The goal is to transform raw employee data (provided in **`HR_Analytics.csv`**) into actionable insights, primarily focusing on **Employee Attrition**, **Workforce Engagement**, and **Performance Management**.

The dashboard serves as a single source of truth for HR and Management teams, facilitating data-driven decision-making to improve employee retention and optimize human capital.

## 💾 Data Source & Preparation

The project utilizes the **`HR_Analytics.csv`** file.

### Data Attributes
The dataset is rich with over 30 attributes, including:

* `Department`, `JobRole`, `JobLevel`
* `MonthlyIncome`, `PercentSalaryHike`
* `TotalWorkingYears`, `YearsAtCompany`
* `JobSatisfaction`, `WorkLifeBalance`

### 🔧 Data Modeling and Transformation
Power BI's **Power Query Editor** was used for the following preparation steps:
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handling nulls and correcting data types.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating calculated columns like `AgeGroup` and `SalarySlab` for better segmentation.
3.  **DAX Calculations:** Implementing complex measures for metrics like `Attrition Rate (%)` and `Average Satisfaction Score`.
